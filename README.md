# SWE-599 Realistic Deepfake Video Generation using GANs

## Project Overview
This project aims to generate realistic fake face videos by leveraging state-of-the-art GAN-based deepfake techniques. The core idea is to create a fake version of a person by swapping their face into an existing video, making it look like they are speaking or performing actions they never did. For example, using a video of Mert and overlaying another person's face onto it in a seamless and realistic way.

## Project Objectives
Investigate recent (post-2023) literature on deepfake video generation techniques.  
Select one or more methods with publicly available code and explore their implementation.  
Use real-world sample videos to create deepfake results.  

Evaluate the generated videos using metrics such as:

- SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)
- PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
- FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance)

## Tools & Technologies
- DeepFaceLab (for face-swapping and model training)
- Python
